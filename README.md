## About
Repository dedicated to projects from UFRJ Theory of Computation course (EEL881)

Computation is associated to a problem solution realization, that is, a functional calculus based on algorithm. The theory of computation, a subsection from Computer Science and Mathematics, seeks for problems that are computed by a specific model of computation. The earlier researchers have proposed several of such models. One of those models, known as Turing machines, proposes the construction of a universal device, capable of operating a sequence of instructions and data written on an infinite length tape. This machine operates each time on one tape slot by using a read/write head, and thus executing a program. Another model is based on recursive functions constructed in order to directly operate numbers. It is an approach similar to Lambda Calculus. Moreover, there is another approach with deals with grammar rules operation over a character sequence, such as Markov chains and Post systems. All those formalisms are computationally power equivalent, that is, any computation made into one model can also be made into the other models. Additionally, all those proposed models are equivalent to electronic computers. In fact, it is believed that all theoretical formalizations of the algorithm concept have equivalent computational power of a Turing machine; this is the Church-Turing thesis. The Theory of Computation studies issues concerned to the possibility of performing certain computations on certain machines (or theoretical formalism).
